      <h1 class="description">
        I’m currently a first-year IT student at West Visayas State University.
        I chose IT because of my interest in technology and my goal to become a
        full-stack software engineer. Outside of school, I’m really passionate
        about sports and fitness. My hobbies include going to the gym, playing
        basketball, and engaging in various team-bonding activities. That’s a
        bit about me—thank you!
